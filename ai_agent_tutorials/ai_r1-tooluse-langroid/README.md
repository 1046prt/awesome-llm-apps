## Example Test Prompts

### 1. Real-time Event Processing System
"We're building a real-time event processing system for a smart city infrastructure that needs to handle 100,000 IoT sensors, process environmental data, manage traffic flows, and provide emergency response capabilities. The system needs to be highly available, handle peak loads during emergencies, and maintain data integrity. Budget constraints exist but reliability is critical."

### 2. Healthcare Data Platform
"Design a HIPAA-compliant healthcare data platform that needs to integrate with legacy systems, handle real-time patient monitoring, support ML-based diagnostics, and manage secure data sharing between different healthcare providers. The system should scale to handle data from 50 hospitals and support both real-time analytics and batch processing."

### 3. Financial Trading Platform
"We need to build a high-frequency trading platform that processes market data streams, executes trades with sub-millisecond latency, maintains audit trails, and handles complex risk calculations. The system needs to be globally distributed, handle 100,000 transactions per second, and have robust disaster recovery capabilities."

### 4. Multi-tenant SaaS Platform
"Design a multi-tenant SaaS platform for enterprise resource planning that needs to support customization per tenant, handle different data residency requirements, support offline capabilities, and maintain performance isolation between tenants. The system should scale to 10,000 concurrent users and support custom integrations."

### 5. Digital Content Delivery Network
"We're building a global content delivery platform for streaming high-definition video content, supporting live streaming, VOD, and interactive content. The system needs to handle dynamic transcoding, support DRM, manage user-generated content, and optimize delivery based on network conditions and device capabilities."

### 6. Supply Chain Management System
"Design a blockchain-based supply chain management system that needs to track products from source to retail, integrate with IoT sensors for condition monitoring, support smart contracts for automated settlements, and provide real-time visibility across the supply chain. The system should handle 1000 partners and support regulatory compliance reporting."

Each of these prompts presents complex architectural challenges that require careful consideration of:
- Scalability patterns
- Data consistency requirements
- Security and compliance needs
- Integration complexities
- Performance optimization
- Cost-benefit trade-offs
- Technical debt implications
- Team expertise requirements

The DeepSeek model will analyze these requirements and provide structured recommendations using the ProjectAnalysis schema, which Claude can then use to provide detailed implementation guidance.
